The defeat of the 'local war' and the first war of destruction.
</head>
<div>
<p>
     <s>In face of the danger of a total collapse of their puppet regime and army, the United States had to dispatch expeditionary troops to South Vietnam.</s>
     <s>In February 1965 the first units of the US aggressors massively landed in the South.</s>
     <s>In late 1965, there were 200,000 troops of the United States and the satellite countries as well as 500,000 local puppet troops in the South.</s>
     <s>That was not to count the US forces that were regularly mobilised from the Seventh Fleet, Thailand, Guam and Japan for the Vietnam War.</s>
     <s>At this stage, the United States used the troops of satellite countries and the puppet army as the strategic force, and the US troops as the core to carry out the war of aggression.</s>
     <s>The revolutionary cause in the South entered a new fighting stage characteristic of an offensive strategy.</s>
     <s>The people and army in the South inflicted on the enemy shattering blows as soon as the US troops set foot to our land.</s>
     <s>The battles in Nui Thanh (Quang Nam) on the night of May 27, in Da Nang on the night of June 30, and, particularly, in Van Tuong (Quang Ngai) on August 18-19, 1965 became our glorious victories.</s>
     <s>In Van Tuong, the United States mobilised 8,000 naval, infantry and airborne troops so as to lay siege to and destroy a liberation army unit ten times smaller than their force.</s>
     <s>With high fighting spirit, the Liberation Army troops killed 1,000 enemy troops, set on fire 22 tanks and shot down 13 airplanes.</s>
     <s>This marked the defeat of the 'local war.'</s>
     <s>Having sent many troops to South Vietnam, the US imperialists concentrated 200,000 troops supported by major naval, air, artillery and mechanised forces to launch the first strategic counter-offensive in the dry season in 1965-1966, mainly in three regions: Tay Nguyen (the Central Highlands), the plain in the Military Zone No5 and in Dong Nam Bo (southeast of the South) including the vicinity of Saigon.</s>
     <s>On the offensive, the popular forces in the South heroically confronted the enemy, completely destroying many units of the United States and puppet troops such as in Play Cu (Gia Lai), Bau Bang, Bau Tieng, Nha Do - Bau Trang (Thu Dau Mot), A Sau (Thua Thien) and Dong Giap (Quang Ngai).</s>
     <s>The enemy nerve-centres in Saigon, Da Nang, Hue, and major airports such as Bien Hoa, Chu Lai, Da Nang, An Khe were attacked.</s>
     <s>US important military bases were encircled, and lines of communication by land and waterway were threatened and cut off.</s>
     <s> Despite their setback in the first counter-offensive, in the dry season of 1966-1967, the US troops again launched a second strategic counter-offensive.</s>
     <s>A force many times bigger than the previous one was mustered.</s>
     <s>The US troops increased to 440,000 from 200,000, consisting of the most seasoned divisions.</s>
     <s>The number of aircraft doubled to 4,300. Tanks and armoured cars increased by 2.5 times with 3,300 in number.</s>
     <s>The number artillery pieces increased by two times with 2,300 pieces in total.</s>
     <s>Warships increased by five times with 230 in number.</s>
     <s>With almost one million troops from the United States, the satellite countries and the puppet army and huge war facilities, a number of major operations were launched such as Attleboro, Cedar Falls and Junction City into the liberated areas, in conjunction with the intensification of the "pacification" plan aimed at destroying our main military force.</s>
     <s>However, the Americans and their puppets were defeated like in their first counter-offensive.</s>
     <s>Our forces continued to grow militarily and politically, the liberated area was protected and expanded.</s>
     <s> In parallel with their war of aggression against the South, the Americans recklessly widened the war to the North in the form of an air and naval war of destruction.</s>
     <s>On August 5, 1964 using the "Tonkin Gulf event" as a pretext, the Americans launched air raids against North Vietnam.</s>
     <s>From February 7, 1965 the war of destruction was extended in its scope.</s>
     <s>This act constituted a aggression of the Americans against an independent and sovereign country, trampling upon international laws.</s>
     <s>Carrying out the air war of destruction with a scope never seen before, the Americans wanted to bolster the spirit of the declining puppet regime and army, threaten the liberated areas and impede the economic construction and military strengthening of the North, block the aid from the North to the South, and shake the will and determination of our people to resist.</s>
     <s>For that reason, the destruction first concentrated by the Americans on Vinh Linh, Quang Binh, Ha Tinh and Nghe An was later extended throughout the North, including Hanoi and other cities.</s>
     <s>Bridges, roads, economic bases, river dykes, hospitals, schools, churches, pagodas, cultural projects, historical sites, inhabited areas, etc became targets of destruction by US planes and warships.</s>
     <s>The anti-American resistance for national salvation constituted the most sacred task of every patriotic Vietnamese at that time.</s>
     <s>In his appeal on July 17, 1965 President Ho Chi Minh confirmed: "The war could last 5, 10, 20 years or even more.</s>
     <s>Hanoi, Haiphong, and a number of other cities and enterprises can be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people shall never be intimidated.</s>
     <s>Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom".</s>
     <s>Fighting back against the air war of destruction, the people and army in the North carried out the people's war in a creative way: all the people engaged in battle against the enemy airplanes and warships to defend the air and sea space of the Fatherland.</s>
     <s>The entire North became a staunch, iron battlefield.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>On April 3-4, 1965 in the air space of Thanh Hoa province, our air force engaged in the first air battle and set a glorious exploit.</s>
     <s>On July 24, 1965 our surface to air missile force won the first resounding victory: shooting down three US airplanes and capturing pilots.</s>
     <s>Working day and night under the enemy bombardment, forces of army engineers, young volunteers, and frontline workers ensured the lines of communication to the front.</s>
     <s>Slogans such as "Enemy destroys, we heal," "For trucks to go to the front, we are willing to sacrifice our house to build the road," "Defeat the enemy to go, open the way to advance" spoke for the determination of the people in the North to render aid and supply to their brothers in the South.</s>
     <s>In four years (August 1964 - November 1968) the people and army in the North shot down more than 3,200 US airplanes, killing or capturing 7,000 pilots, and set on fire many warships of the Americans and their puppets.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Defeated in the two strategic counter-offensives in the South and in the air war against the North, the US imperialists were put into a dilemma.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The balance of force changed in favour of our forces.</s>
     <s>The time came when big efforts of the people and army in both the North and the South were to be mobilised in order to take the revolutionary war to a new step and win decisive victory in the battlefield.</s>
     <s>After opening the Tri-Thien front and launching successive attacks on the Americans and their puppets who had to mobilise more reinforcements for rescue, our forces launched a major offensive during Tet (Lunar New Year) 1968m, attacking central political and military commands, garrisons, airports, and depots of the enemy.</s>
     <s>The war was brought by our people and army to cities, provincial towns, and sensitive strongholds of the Americans and their puppets, causing huge losses to them.</s>
     <s>Standing out amidst the strong impact of our offensive was the heroic struggle of the people and combatants of Saigon, Hue and Da Nang.</s>
     <s>More than 1.2 million troops of the United States, the satellite countries and the Saigon regime hardly had time to turn their head and were stunned and puzzled.</s>
     <s>The offensive and uprising served as the decisive blow on the "local war" strategy, shaking the will of aggression of the US imperialists.</s>
     <s>In a difficult situation, on March 31, 1968 the United States had to de-escalate the bombing against the North.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The offensive and uprising of the people in the South during the Tet 1968 and the triumph of the North over the war of destruction forced the US imperialists to de-escalate the war and accept negotiations with our government.</s>
     <s>The quadripartite conference took place on January 18, 1969. The revolutionary struggle of our people entered a new stage when the struggle was simultaneously waged in the military, political and diplomatic fronts.</s>
