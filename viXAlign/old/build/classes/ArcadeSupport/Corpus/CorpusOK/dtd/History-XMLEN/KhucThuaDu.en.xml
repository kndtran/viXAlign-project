Khuc Thua Du builds the sovereignty.
</head>
<div>
<p>
     <s>In the late ninth century, China was engulfed in chaos.</s>
     <s>The Tang was unable to exercise its control over our country as before and changed the post of protector to that of governor.</s>
     <s>The governor, on behalf of the Tang authority, had the power to determine all matters including the selection of his heir.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Khuc Thua Du was a local chief whose homeland was in Cuc Bo, Hong Chau (Ninh Giang, Hai Duong).</s>
     <s>The Khuc was a big, age-old and well-known family.</s>
     <s>Khuc Thua Du was a man of generosity and philanthropy who was greatly admired by the people in the locality.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In mid 905, taking advantage of the internal dispute in the Tang court and the disposal of their governor in our country, Khuc Thua Du launched a revolt, captured Tong Binh citadel and proclaimed himself governor.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The Tang dynasty was put before a fait accompli.</s>
     <s>Early next year, the Tang emperor officially promoted Khuc Thua Du as governor.</s>
     <s>From then, Khuc Thua Du nominally got a post of mandarin of the Tang dynasty but, in fact, the domination of the Chinese feudal regime in our country was terminated.</s>
     <s>Thus our country gained back its sovereignty.</s>
     <s>This served as an initial important step so as to regain complete national independence at a later stage.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Khuc Thua Du was in the position of governor for two years before he passed away.</s>
     <s>His son Khuc Hao succeeded his career proclaiming himself governor.</s>
     <s>He immediately set to build the country along the line that "political affairs mean, in essence, charity, simplicity and happiness to people".</s>
     <s>Khuc Hao revised the administrative sector and assigned his men to look after the affairs to the commune level.</s>
     <s>The new authority also revised the land tax system and promulgated a more appropriate one and, at the same time, lifted all hard and duties.</s>
     <s>Khuc Hao also restored the household registration to serve as a basis for tax collection and recruitment for the army.</s>
