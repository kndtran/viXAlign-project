The strengthening of the North and the defeat of the "special war" in the South.
</head>
<div>
<p>
     <s>In the Political Report at the third Party Congress, Le Duan, the then acting General Secretary of the Party, said that the tasks of the socialist revolution in the North played the most decisive role for the development of the entire national revolution as well as national reunification.</s>
     <s> The feature governing the socialist revolution in the North was the temporary partition of the country.</s>
     <s>The cause of the socialist revolution therefore, first and foremost, was to turn the North into a solid base for the entire revolutionary cause of the whole country and the liberation of the South.</s>
     <s>The cause of socialist construction in the North was to muster all strength for the liberation of the South.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The socialist revolution in the North was a process of all-round transformation with a view to turning the North from an economy mainly based on private ownership of means of production, into a socialist economy based on the ownership of the entire people and collective ownership, from a small-scale production into a large-scale socialist, from a backward and dispersed economy into a balanced and modern one, bringing about swift progresses to make it an ever stronger base for the national reunification.</s>
     <s>Industrialisation was the only way to transform the backward economy.</s>
     <s>Socialist industrialisation constituted the focal task of the transitional period to socialism in the country.</s>
     <s>In order to facilitate socialist industrialisation in the North, every effort was made to achieve all-round development of agriculture based on co-operativisation and technical renovation, expand State-run farms, muster positive factors of tropical agricultural production to start the building of industry, develop agriculture in parallel with industry, and closely associate industry with agriculture.</s>
     <s>The socialist revolution was conducted in the North not only economically, but also ideologically and culturally.</s>
     <s>To fulfil the task of advancing the North to socialism, the people's democratic state had to be strengthened and consolidated, creating a political and ideological unity of the entire people to safeguard the cause of socialist construction and fulfil socialist transformation.</s>
     <s>The Party had to be built politically, ideologically and organisationally so as to enhance its leading role and fighting ability.</s>
     <s>The first five-year plan (1961-1965) focused on gaining a step along the path of socialist industrialisation, laying the initial material and technical foundation for socialism and fulfilling socialist transformation in the North.</s>
     <s>The North thus fulfilled its role of the great base and rear for the great frontline in the South.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>On the basis of the Resolution of the fifteenth Conference of the Party Central Committee, the Resolution of the third Party Congress pointed out: the revolution in the South would exert a direct influence on the liberation of the South from the domination of the US imperialists and their lackeys, bring about peace and national reunification and fulfil the people's national democratic tasks throughout the country.</s>
     <s> Taking over Eisenhower as the US president, Kennedy made some adjustment to Eisenhower's so as to achieve the United States' strategic aims and confirm the United States' leading role over the world, and building "a great US century".</s>
     <s>In carrying out this plot, Kennedy approved a new strategy and selected South Vietnam as testing ground for the "special war", up-to-date weapons and new war methods to repress the revolution movement of the people in South Vietnam for subsequent applications in Asia, Africa and Latin America to suppress the liberation movements, jeopardise new independent countries and compel them to accept the US neo-colonialist policy.</s>
     <s>The "special war" strategy was a form characteristic of US neo-colonialism carried out in South Vietnam using "the Vietnamese to fight the Vietnamese" with the combination of barbarous US measures of aggression war based on modern arms and techniques and barbarous suppressive and terrorising measures of pro-American feudal revanchists and capitalists in the South.</s>
     <s>Those directly involved in carrying out the war were representatives of feudal landlords, comprador bourgeoisie and the US lackeys.</s>
     <s>The main force carrying out the "special war" was the army of the Saigon puppet regime organised, equipped, nurtured and led by the United States.</s>
     <s>In more than three years in power, Kennedy gave all his heart and mind to directing this war.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The Staley-Taylor scheme was an all-round and long-term plan of the United States consisting of the re-division of the theatre of war, redeployment of the forces, enhancement and expansion of power to the US military advisors; increase of civil guard and militia forces, set-up of no-man's regions along Vietnam-Lao and Vietnam-Cambodia borders; intensification of psychological war, spying activities and commando raids, gathering of inhabitants into "strategic hamlets" with a view to separating our people - mainly peasants - from the revolution, encroachment of liberated areas, and re-imposing of their grip in the countryside, an area that had been extensively lost during the "chain uprising" movement in 1959-1960.</s>
     <s>In October 1961, the Diem administration issued a decree putting South Vietnam in "unrestricted emergency" and compelled the puppet assembly to approve a resolution authorising the president to implement a number of fascist measures to oppress the people and plunder manpower and wealth for the "special war".</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>However, all these plots could in no way curb the revolutionary offensive of the people in the South.</s>
     <s>With diversified forms of struggle, from low to high, from demanding the improvement of living conditions and implementation of democratic freedoms to the overthrow of the puppet regime, the struggle movement of the peasants continued to grow in an ever-increasing scale, making a big echo to the cities.</s>
     <s>The working class in the South worthily served as the mainstay and always stood in the frontline of the struggle.</s>
     <s>On December 12, 1962 in a press conference, President Kennedy admitted that "it was difficult to wage a war against the guerilla.</s>
     <s>The United States was in a tunnel without the way out".</s>
     <s>As a testimony to his statement, on January 2, 1963 our people won a glorious victory in the Ap Bac battle (My Tho).</s>
     <s>With a force less than one tenth of the enemy, the Liberation Army fought a battle against more than 2,000 enemy troops under the cover of warships, armoured cars, amphibious vehicles, aircraft and heavy guns commanded by a US general in their encirclement of and mopping-up operation against Ap Bac.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>After one day of steadfast fighting, the Liberation Army forces broke a number of the enemy attacks, putting out of action more than 450 troops, killing three US officers, shooting down three helicopters, capturing one warship and destroying three M113 armoured cars.</s>
     <s>The Ap Bac victory was of important military and political importance.</s>
     <s>It marked the swift growth of the Liberation Army with the defeat of anti-guerilla methods seen as most effective by the enemy such as "heli-borne," "carrier borne," etc.</s>
     <s>The contradiction between the United States and Diem grew more acute, and anti-American and anti-Diem demonstrations widely spread.</s>
     <s>The then situation put the United States before a choice of either "swim and sink" or "swap the horse in midstream" with Diem.</s>
     <s>After a period of preparations under the direction of the United States, on November 1, 1963 a number of generals and commanders in the puppet army were resorted to waging a coup, killing both Diem and Nhu.</s>
     <s>The collapse of the Diem administration marked a big victory of the people in the South in their patriotic struggle.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>After the collapse of the Diem regime, despite the intensification of the "special war," with series of measures such as raising the number of the puppet army to 600,000 and the number of the US advisors to 25,000, pouring up-to-date war facilities such as helicopters, M113 armoured cars, etc into South Vietnam, using toxic chemicals, setting up the Military Aid Command in Saigon, and seducing a number of the US satellite countries into the war of aggression, the situation continued to deteriorate for the aggressors and their lackeys.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The assassination of Kennedy in late 1963 brought Johnson to power who intensified the war of aggression against our country.</s>
     <s>The bankrupt Staley-Taylor scheme was replaced by Johnson-McNamara plan with the concentration of forces of the United States and the puppet army on the "pacification" in the Mekong river delta and the middle of central Vietnam aimed at seizing back the initiative in the two coming years of 1964 and 1965.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In response, the people and army in South Vietnam consecutively smashed big raids waged by the United States and the puppet army, setting up new glorious victories.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>After more than four years of heroic and staunch fighting against the "special war," the people and army in the South pushed the United States and the puppet regime into a difficult situation.</s>
     <s>Forces of the Liberation Army brought into play an initiative, launching continuous attacks on the enemy including their "main pacification main points".</s>
     <s>With its elite troops, the Liberation Army forces launched major attacks on the enemy strongholds, bringing the armed struggle into towns and cities.</s>
     <s>The system of "strategic hamlets" collapsed piece by piece.</s>
     <s>The struggle movement of the urban inhabitants continued to develop.</s>
     <s>The liberated area continued to widen which was built into a firm rear on the spot.</s>
     <s>The US lackeys became further decayed internally after a series of military coups to usurp the power.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In 1965, when the US aggressors levelled up the "special war" to a climax, the war of liberation achieved a major leap forward with the victory of Binh Gia (Ba Ria), defeating many enemy battalions, killing 2,000 local troops, killing and capturing 19 US aggressors and shooting down 35 airplanes.</s>
     <s>The Pentagon had to admit that it was the biggest and most painful defeat since the war of aggression was waged against our country.</s>
     <s>Following the victory of Binh Gia, new victories of Duong Lieu-Deo Nhong (Binh Dinh), Viet An (Quang Nam), and, particularly, Ba Gia (Quang Ngai) were achieved in May 1965.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Amidst the victories in the front, the people and army in the North were on high alert, inflicting a heavy blow to the US air and naval war of destruction on August 5, 1964 and early 1965, firmly defending the great rear base.</s>
     <s>By then, "the special war" was seen to be completely defeated.</s>
