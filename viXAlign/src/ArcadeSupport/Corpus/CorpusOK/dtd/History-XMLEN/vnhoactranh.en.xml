Defeating the "Vietnamisation" of the war.
</head>
<div>
<p>
     <s>In July 1969, Nixon made public his doctrine to stablise and increase the strength of the United States both militarily and economically, share its responsibility with the allies, conduct negotiations with socialist countries from a position of strength, make use of disaccords among these countries and threaten the small countries.</s>
     <s>Nixon chose Vietnam as the testing ground for his doctrine with the birth of the "Vietnamisation" strategy.</s>
     <s>However, "Vietnamisation of the war" could not avoid a fatal failure.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Throughout the terms of the three US Presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson) their war plans and strategies applied to Vietnam were in turn defeated.</s>
     <s>After taking over the presidency, Richard Nixon - representative of the "hawk" tendency in the United States - changed Johnson's "de-Americanisation" to "Vietnamisation" vis-a-vis South Vietnam.</s>
     <s>In essence, this policy advocated the "use of the Vietnamese to fight the Vietnamese" with US weapons, facilities and command in combination with regional reactionary alliance so as to isolate and defeat the Vietnamese revolution.</s>
     <s>The principal aim of Nixon's "Vietnamisation of the war" was to withdraw US troops from South Vietnam whilst remaining able to maintain the puppet regime to drag on and expand the war.</s>
     <s>In less than four years from 1969 to 1972, the puppet regular and local forces were increased from 700 thousand to 1.1 million in number and paramilitary troops, from 1,500 thousand to 2,000 thousand.</s>
     <s>By late 1972, the Saigon army had 1,100 aircraft and helicopters, and 2,000 tanks and armoured cars.</s>
     <s>Together with the build-up of the Saigon army, the United States further strengthened the Saigon regime to grip the people, and increased aid to build a stable economy.</s>
     <s>With this strategy, the White House and Pentagon hoped they could get out of the impasse and win victory on the battlefield.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>On the night to dawn of February 22-23, 1969, the people and armed forces in South Vietnam launched chain attacks on more than 400 enemy targets in 36 cities and towns, more than 100 townships and districts, 35 command posts, 38 airports, and 17 major logistic depots.</s>
     <s> In late 1969, the US command organised and directed a big operation to encroach liberated areas in Laos.</s>
     <s>The "Laotianisation of the war" was seen as the start to draw experience for "Vietnamisation".</s>
     <s>The operation ended in total defeat.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In March 1970, Nixon ordered the coup in Phnom Penh, overthrowing the legitimate government of the Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, sending troops to Cambodia and expanding the war throughout Indochina.</s>
     <s>However, this adventurous act further engulfed them in an even more difficult situation.</s>
     <s>The Summit of the Indochinese Peoples taking place on July 24, 1970 served as a new symbol of militant solidarity among the three fraternal countries with determination to defeat the US imperialists and their puppets to win national independence for each country.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In late January 1971, the US command mobilised more than 20,000 puppet troops with the support of 20,000 US troops and artillery to launch a major operation to Highway No9 and southern Laos with a view to cutting off the supply routes for the revolution in the South.</s>
     <s>The operation was typical of the strategy of "Vietnamisation of the war".</s>
     <s>However, the operation was inflicted with a shattering blow by Vietnamese people and armed forces in co-ordination with Laos' patriotic forces.</s>
     <s>Suffering heavy losses, the enemy finally had to flee.</s>
     <s>This Highway No9 - Southern Lao victory put an end to the "attacks and counter-attacks" on outer rings of the US-puppet troops with major operations in the Indochinese battlefield.</s>
     <s>Also, our people and armed forces foiled the "pacification" policy that served as the backbone of "Vietnamisation".</s>
     <s>Even in areas controlled by Nguyen Van Thieu regime, the popular struggle movement in both cities and the countryside continued to grow.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>From March 30 to August 1972, the people and armed forces in the South synchronously launched a strategic offensive throughout the battlefield, destroying regular forces of the puppet army, combining offensives with uprisings in the countryside and waging the struggle politically, militarily and diplomatically.</s>
     <s>Our strategic offensive in 1972 foiled the first important step of the "Vietnamisation" plan, pushing the Americans and their puppets into a serious weakening situation in every aspect.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>From mid-April, 1972 in order to save the Saigon army and the "Vietnamisation" plan from a collapse, Nixon openly broke the US government's commitment in November 1968 and got back to "Americanisation of the war," mobilising massive air and naval forces for a second war of destruction against the North.</s>
     <s>With major forces (1,400 tactical airplanes, 200 strategic B52s and almost 10 aircraft carriers and warships) together with up-to-date weapons and technology, the United States carried out barbarous bombardments and raids by air to destroy populated areas, transport lines, economic bases, cities, provincial towns, villages, schools, hospitals, churches, etc in the North.</s>
     <s>They also laid mines to block seaports and the coast along our country.</s>
     <s>With Vietnam's experience drawn from defeating the US war of destruction four years before, and with economic and military growth during 1969-1971, the North smashed the new US military operation.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>To save an irreversible defeat both in the North and the South, manipulate a new adventure to gain strength on the conference table, and impose conditions to end the war, from December 18-29, 1972 Nixon ordered the strategic assault by B52s into Hanoi and Haiphong.</s>
     <s>As early as on the night of 18 December, our air defence forces violently fought back the assault and won victory.</s>
     <s>In 12 days, 81 US aircraft were shot down, 34 of which were B52s, hundreds of US pilots were killed or taken prisoner.</s>
     <s>The people and army of the North won a glorious victory in the "Dien Bien Phu air-battle".</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The victory of the strategic offensive of the people and armed forces in the South to defeat the "Vietnamisation" strategy and the excellent exploit of the people and army in the North to smash the strategic assault by B52s into Hanoi and Haiphong compelled the US government to sign the Paris Agreement to end the war and restore peace in Vietnam on January 27, 1973 in Paris.</s>
