Viet country after Trung Vuong till before Ly Nam De (first century - sixth century).
</head>
<div>
<p>
     <s>I- The ruling yoke of the Chinese dynasties.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>After the defeat of the two Trung sisters, Vietnam was again dominated by the Chinese feudal dynasties.</s>
     <s>The Han split the country into districts of China and imposed their ruling apparatus.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>These districts and cantons were separated and integrated on a number of occasions, but in general the land of former Au Lac which was renamed Giao Chau, consisting of three districts: Giao Chi, Cuu Chan and Nhat Nam with about 50 cantons.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Chau Giao was headed by a proconsul who was sent from China and had full power to appoint functionaries and command the entire army.</s>
     <s>Each district was ruled by a Han governor who was assisted by a number of Han mandarins.</s>
     <s>Under districts were cantons.</s>
     <s>The hereditary position of Lac tuong (military chief) of the Viet people at canton level was cancelled.</s>
     <s>In replacement of them were now Han chiefs.</s>
     <s>Canton chiefs ordered the construction of fortifications and positioned troops at canton townships.</s>
     <s>The ruling authority made efforts to improve and build anew roads to link district and canton townships with Long Bien (Bac Ninh) where the ruling apparatus and army centred.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Laws and customs of the Viet people were abandoned and they had to follow Chinese laws.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The ruling authority vigorously carried out the immigration of the Han people to settle among with the Viet population and impelled the Viet to abandon their life customs and practices and follow those of the Han.</s>
     <s>With a view to disseminating the thoughts of "obeying the son of Heaven" and "yielding to the rule of Heaven," they forced the Viet people to learn Chinese.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The Viet people were heavily oppressed, blocked and exploited.</s>
     <s>Production, culture and society were seriously hampered.</s>
     <s>Losing the country was the greatest grief of all.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Instead of submitting to the foreign domination, the Viet people incessantly carried out the struggle for life, economic and cultural developments and national independence.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>II- Economic development of our country from the first - sixth centuries.</s>
     <s>1. Ironware and farming Since the An Duong Vuong's time our ancestors were able to grasp the technique to forge and cast ironware although iron was still rather rare at that time.</s>
     <s>Having conquered our country, the ruling authority imposed the posts of mandarins to exercise a strict control over the exploitation, production and trading of iron ore and ware.</s>
     <s>They kept a monopoly of iron production.</s>
     <s>Despite all this, the Viet people forged and cast various types of iron tools and weapons.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In ancient graves belonging to that period, only a small number of bronze weapons and almost no bronze tools were discovered.</s>
     <s>That means tools and weapons, in the main, were made of iron.</s>
     <s>Tools consisted of axes, hoes, knives, spades, etc.</s>
     <s>Weapons comprised swords, spears and lances.</s>
     <s>Even household utensils such as tripods, lambs, incense burners, etc were made of iron.</s>
     <s>Cock spurs were also tipped with iron.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Together with the wide use of iron production tools, oxen and buffaloes were commonly used as pulling power.</s>
     <s>As a result, farming land was expanded and irrigation works were built.</s>
     <s>Along big rivers such as the Red and Ma rivers, dykes were built to curb floods.</s>
     <s>A number of canals, streams and trenches were dug or drudged for irrigation purpose.</s>
     <s>Our ancestors knew how to use various types of fertilisers to improve their farm land.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Thanks to the cultivation of crops and the knowledge of weather conditions and farming techniques, the Viet people increased to two rice crops per year from only one.</s>
     <s>The rice yield was the highest in south-east Asia by that time.</s>
     <s>Besides rice, other industrial crops were grown such as cotton, jute and yarn.</s>
     <s>Particularly, mulberry trees were grown for breeding silk-worms, unravelling cocoons and weaving silk.</s>
     <s>Sugarcane was grown to be refined into treacle and cane sugar.</s>
     <s>Giao Chi's sugarcane plant was famous for "its equal quality from the root to the top" with sweet-smelling and fresh flavour.</s>
     <s>Bamboo was grown to build houses, make boats and other bamboo ware.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Vegetables, aubergines and fruit trees of lychee, banana, coconut, sapindus, etc were grown.</s>
     <s>Fish were raised in ponds and lakes, convolvulus and lotus were grown afloat and on rafts.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Besides oxen, buffaloes, pigs, chicken, goats, dogs, ducks, geese, etc, horses and elephants were kept to supply pulling power or to be used in battles.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>2. Handicrafts and trade.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In addition to mining and bronze and iron castings as described above, other traditional handicrafts such as pottery and weaving achieved a very strong growth.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Pottery makers produced home utensils such as pots, jars, bowls, dishes, food trays, pans and lamps.</s>
     <s>Pottery ware was glazed or semi-glazed.</s>
     <s>Bricks and tiles consisted of various types.</s>
     <s>Besides the common types, there were tubular tiles and bricks resembling a section of a grapefruit for the building of vaulted architecture.</s>
     <s>Cloth was not only made of cotton, yarn and jute, but also of bamboo and banana fibres.</s>
     <s>Particularly, there were types of fine and airy calico, and beautiful and strong silk which were well-known.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Through trade and cultural exchanges with foreign countries, the Viet people apprehended new techniques and developed a number of new industries such as paper, glassware, silver and gold jewellery.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Copying China's production of paper, the Viet people used plants and tree bark to make their own paper products such as giay do (rhamnoneuron paper), giay rom (straw paper), etc.</s>
     <s>Particular, mat huong paper which was made of sandalwood was fragrant, strong, white and beautifully-grained.</s>
     <s>In the late third century, Greek merchants bought thirty thousand sheets to present to the Greek king because the paper industry had not appeared in Europe by that time.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Together with the development of the farming and handicrafts, internal and external trade recorded a fast growth.</s>
     <s>A number of farming and handicraft products that were not taken as tributes were exchanged in local marketplaces.</s>
     <s>The communications network consisted of rivers, dike systems and village roads.</s>
     <s>Marketplaces were organised at commune, canton, district and country levels.</s>
     <s>In populated areas such as Luy Lau and Long Bien, foreign merchants usually came for trade.</s>
     <s>Besides the Han, there were Indian and Javan peoples.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Among the imported products were chinaware and Chinese traditional medicine.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The export consisted of forest and native products, handicrafts and art objects.</s>
     <s>Trade of serfs was also common.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Chinese mandarins kept a monopoly of trade.</s>
     <s>They prohibited the Viet people to conduct direct trade with foreign merchants.</s>
     <s>As for foreign merchant ships, heavy anchorage tax was imposed, grand banquets were required and goods had to be sold at a low price.</s>
     <s>However, trade with foreigners actually created a certain stimulus to the economic and cultural developments of our country.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>III- Society and culture from the first to sixth centuries.</s>
     <s>1. Social changes.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Prior to the aggression and domination by the Chinese feudalists, polarisation had already taken place in the Au Lac society.</s>
     <s>Despite a strict impediment from the first to sixth centuries, the Viet people step-by-step speeded up production and economic development.</s>
     <s>Albeit slow, the economic development led to changes in the society of our country.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Since the domination was imposed, the entire land of communes and villages were seen as ownership of the ruling authority.</s>
     <s>Farmers who ploughed and cultivated on this land had to pay taxes and render corvee and duties to the authority.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Together with the exploitation of farmers, the ruling authority seized land of communes and villages and had more land reclaimed to set up plantations.</s>
     <s>Those who worked in the State-owned plantations became farm peasants.</s>
     <s>The functionaries also seized land to set up their own plantations and those who worked there became subordinate peasants.</s>
     <s>They had to pay taxes, render corvee and military service to their lords.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In society, besides the majority of farmers there was a small number of people who enjoyed power, taxes, labour and services from all strata of the farmers.</s>
     <s>This class consisted of big Han mandarins and landlords.</s>
     <s>They seized vast land of farmers to set up their own plantations.</s>
     <s>Also, there were Viet chiefs who were powerful and rich in localities.</s>
     <s>But in general, they were blocked and looked down upon by the ruling authority.</s>
     <s>It was this circle who led the Viet people to drive out the dominators to win back the national independence.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>2. Language, art and way of life of the Viet people.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>With the opening of schools in cantons, Chinese characters and spoken language were introduced into our country on a massive scale.</s>
     <s>Confucian ideologies and customs and practices of the Han people were also brought into our country.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>However, only a number of people of the upper class living in townships learned the knowledge and were influenced.</s>
     <s>Working people in communes and villages kept speaking the language of their ancestors.</s>
     <s>Through centuries of exchanges and contacts with the Han people who settled in Vietnam, the Viet people, step-by-step, familiarised themselves with the Han language.</s>
     <s>But with their own way of pronunciation and usage, they localised many Chinese words to form new Vietnamese words (Sino-Vietnamese) to enrich their own language.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The Viet people also made best choice of the quintessence of the Chinese and Indian arts which reached a high level of development and had a strong influences in Asia at that time.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Although the ruling authority tried to impose rites and customs of the Han people, the majority of the Viet people in communes and villages maintained their own way of life with traditional customs and practices such as tattooing, teeth dyeing, betel chewing, making of chung and day cakes, etc.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Of the special customs firmly kept was bronze drum beating.</s>
     <s>Whenever a new bronze drum was cast, the whole village was invited to a ceremony.</s>
     <s>Honour was always given to a woman in the village to make the first beat on the drum despite the feudal ideology of male chauvinism which was disseminated at large by the dominators.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In despite of the prevention and prohibition by the ruling authority, the Viet people continued to show their respect and gratitude to those who had great merits toward the nation and community.</s>
     <s>Temples were built in many localities to worship the Hung kings, the two Trung sisters, Heroine Trieu and others.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>From the first century, Buddhism and Confucianism were increasingly introduced into Vietnam.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The ruling authority plotted to use religions to enslave the Viet people and suppress their fighting will.</s>
     <s>However, thanks to their charity and mutual help and protection, they were not divided or turned hostile to one another because of religious beliefs.</s>
