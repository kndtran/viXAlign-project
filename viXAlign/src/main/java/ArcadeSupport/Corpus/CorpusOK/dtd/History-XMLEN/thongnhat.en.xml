Strengthening the North, struggle for reunification.
</head>
<div>
<p>
     <s>The Geneva Agreements were signed and the Vietnamese revolution entered into a turning point with the partition of the country featured as a major characteristic.</s>
     <s> President Ho Chi Minh's appeal on July 22, 1954 read: "All the north, centre and south are within our territory, our country must be unified, the people throughout the country must be freed".</s>
     <s>Totally liberated, North Vietnam moved forward to the socialist revolution.</s>
     <s>However, its economy was weak and backward, tens of thousands of hamlets remained desolated and poverty-stricken; tens of thousands of hectares of land were left fallow; the lives of the people were in a desperate state.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The then international situation was favourable for revolutionary forces.</s>
     <s>The three revolutionary torrents in the world were on the offensive.</s>
     <s>However, disaccord existing among the socialist countries and communist and workers' movement seriously split themselves, particularly between the Soviet Union and China, making our national revolution more difficult, complicated and prolonged.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>South Vietnam was temporarily controlled by the enemy.</s>
     <s>The revolution, with a government, an army and liberated areas now had no government and no army.</s>
     <s>The liberated areas were handed over to the army under the French Union; general elections were planned in two years for national reunification.</s>
     <s>But after the Geneva Conference, the United States compelled the French to make Ngo Dinh Diem Prime Minister in a bid to replace them and impose neo-colonialism in South Vietnam for a long partition and domination.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>The US imperialists tried to undermine the Geneva Agreements, putting aside the French from South Vietnam, splitting and neutralising pro-French forces, setting up the puppet administration, taking control of the puppet army, organising pro-American reactionary parties, carrying out their plot to oppose our cause of national reunification, turning the South into a neo-colony and military base of the United States.</s>
     <s>From 1955-60, the United States poured more than US $1.5 billion worth of arms and war facilities into South Vietnam.</s>
     <s>It was their basic strategic measure to "denounce and exterminate communists" and concentrate their forces to destroy the revolution in the South in an extremely cruel way.</s>
     <s>They resorted to all forces including military, secret, administrative, intelligence, information, psychological and economic, cruelly terrorising and suppressing revolutionary forces.</s>
     <s>Many operations and raids were launched to raze revolutionary bases, killing former revolutionaries who were labelled communists or pro-communists, blood-thirstily carrying out the motto "better kill wrong than miss".</s>
     <s>In carrying out Bill 10/59, guillotines were moved throughout the South.</s>
     <s>The blood of the South Vietnamese people dyed red the land of Huong Dien (Quang Tri), Duy Xuyen, Vinh Trinh and Cho Duoc (Quang Nam), Mo Cay (Ben Tre), 6,000 detainees at the Phu Loi concentration camp were poisoned of which 1,000 were killed.</s>
     <s>Apparently, the US imperialists and their lackeys unilaterally carried out a war against our people who only thirsted for independence, peace and national reunification.</s>
     <s>The people in the South were oppressed, the revolution there was pushed into a difficult situation unseen before, a precarious and seemingly insurmountable setback.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Upholding high its independence, self-reliance, creativity and with its intelligence, our Party step by step charted out the correct revolutionary line, policy and measures so as to take the revolutionary cause in both regions of the country forward through every challenge.</s>
     <s>The Resolutions of the sixth, seventh and eighth Conferences of the Party Central Committee gradually shed light on the revolutionary path of our country ie: continue the struggle for general elections for national reunification, and defend and build the North.</s>
     <s>In order to resist the US imperialists and their lackeys, strengthen peace, strive for reunification, fulfill independence and democracy, "the essential thing is to strengthen the North, at the same time, maintain and speed up the struggle of the people in the South".</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In carrying out this policy, the people and army in the North actively implemented and successfully resolved a number of imperative tasks such as taking-over the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy; fulfilling the repatriation of revolutionary forces to the North; wiping out groups of bandits in the Northwest and Northeast; spoiling the enemy plot to coerce Catholics to move to the South; reclaiming fallow land ravaged by the war; particularly making continued efforts for the land reform, remedying errors committed during the land reform and dressing the organisational matters.</s>
     <s>In the next three years (1958-60), socialist transformation was fundamentally completed in agriculture, industry, commerce, handicraft, basically eradicating exploitation and laid the ground work for economic, cultural and social construction and development along the socialist path.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In early 1957, the twelfth Conference of the Party Central Committee determined the major tasks of building of the army, strengthening the national defence, defending the North, making military preparations for the revolution throughout the country in the new stage.</s>
     <s>Together with these tasks, the Party and State launched a political campaign in the North to oppose the US and Diem's violation of the Geneva Agreements and to side with the people in the South in their struggle against suppression and massacre for national reunification.</s>
     <s> In face of frenzied terror and suppression of the US and Diem, our people in the South raised a strong struggle movement from hamlets to towns.</s>
     <s>The struggle for the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, democratic freedoms and negotiations for national reunification and against terrors took place vehemently and drastically.</s>
     <s>The line to struggle against the US for national salvation mentioned in Le Duan's work 'The Platform of the Revolution in the South' in 1956 was perfected through the 15th Conference of the Party Central Committee in 1959 and the Resolution of the third Party Congress.</s>
     <s>It was obvious that, in order to struggle against the US and Diem to fulfill national independence and reunification, the people in the South had no other choice except the revolutionary path.</s>
     <s> The Resolution 15 of the Party Central Committee came to the people in the South a shower for draught.</s>
     <s>Party cells throughout the South immediately mobilised the people to rise up.</s>
     <s>For the first time, the people's uprisings led to the destruction of the enemy post in Bac Ai (Ninh Thuan), and the set-up of revolutionary power in Tra Bong (Quang Ngai).</s>
     <s>This was followed by battles of armed and self-defense forces on a number of district capitals in Tay Ninh, Thu Dau Mot and Dong Thap.</s>
     <s>In early 1960, our armed forces in Tay Ninh launched surprise attacks on a major position of the enemy in Tua Hai and won a big victory, capturing thousands of pieces of arms and facilitating the expansion of armed units.</s>
     <s>Seizing upon the declination of the puppet regime at the grassroot level, the revolutionary leadership of Ben Tre province mobilised the people to rise up to overthrow the enemy grip, take control of hamlets and communes by political struggle in combination with the military one.</s>
     <s>From Tra Bong (Ben Tre), the wave of a "chain uprising" movement quickly spread throughout the South.</s>
     <s>The uprising movement marked a basic turning point in the patriotic struggle of the people: the revolution in the South shifted to the offensive.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>On December 20, 1960, in a liberated area in the Southeast, delegates of former anti-French militants, workers, peasants, armed forces, national groups, religions, scholars, industrialists, traders, etc declared the foundation of the National Liberation Front of the South Vietnam (NLF).</s>
     <s> The stage from 1955-59 was a historical one in which our revolution faced with numerous difficulties and the South suffered huge losses.</s>
     <s>The only aspiration of our people was independence, peace and reunification to make our country prosperous.</s>
     <s>Our people wished to realise their aspiration through the implementation of the International agreements.</s>
     <s>But the imperialist forces deprived our people of their fundamental rights.</s>
     <s>They made us take up arms.</s>
     <s>The will of the whole nation again put a heavy responsibility for our Party.</s>
     <s>The third Party Congress in 1960 clear-sightedly adopted two strategic tasks that were put under the united leadership of the Party ie to build socialism in the North and to liberate the South for national reunification.</s>
