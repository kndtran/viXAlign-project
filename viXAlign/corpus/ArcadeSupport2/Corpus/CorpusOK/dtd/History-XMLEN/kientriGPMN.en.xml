Persistent on the revolutionary path toward the total liberation of the South.

<p>
     <s>The Paris Agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in Vietnam was signed and the Americans had to completely withdraw from South Vietnam.</s>
     <s>However, they never abandoned their scheme to intervene in Vietnam and continued to aid and encourage the Saigon regime to undermine the Paris Agreement.</s>
     <s>The puppet regime and army continued to be used as a tool to implement neo-colonialism in the South, turning it into a pro-US "State" which in fact was a neo-colony.</s>
     <s> The immediate aim of the Americans and their puppet was to encroach the liberated areas, pacify their temporarily occupied areas, destroy part of our forces and push back the rest to the Vietnam-Lao and Vietnam - Cambodia borders.</s>
     <s>In carrying out this plot, the Americans poured more money, weapons and war facilities into South Vietnam.</s>
     <s>They made every effort to build the Saigon army into the strongest puppet army in Southeast Asia with more than one million troops, organising it into four corps with 13 divisions and many brigades, regiments and battalions, 1,850 airplanes and helicopters, 1,588 artillery pieces, 2,074 tanks, 1,611 warships; and millions of tones of war materials.</s>
     <s>In addition, their civil guards and militia were well equipped.</s>
     <s>The Americans also retained a deterrent force and intensified "big power" diplomacy in order to check the development of the revolution in the South.</s>
     <s>The Saigon regime intensified the conscription of troops by force, strengthened its armed forces at the local level to control the people, continuously launched operations and raids and "territory submerging" campaigns.</s>
     <s>In turn, they introduced war plans aimed at capturing all liberated areas and putting entire South Vietnam under their control within three years (1973-1975).</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>Contrary to their big ambition, the position and strength of the Americans and their puppets after the Paris Agreement deteriorated.</s>
     <s>After withdrawing from the South, the United States was sunken deep in a crisis of confidence, the economy recessed, inflation and unemployment rose, the society was disordered, the government and political parties were deeply divided internally.</s>
     <s>The Watergate scandal plunged the United States deep into a tragic situation.</s>
     <s>Nixon had to resign as president.</s>
     <s>The US military aid to the Saigon regime was gradually cut down, from US $1,614 million in 1972-1973 to US $1,026 million in 1974-1975.</s>
     <s>The government of Nguyen Van Thieu met with insurmountable heaped-up difficulties.</s>
     <s>Lacking ammunitions, the firepower support reduced by almost 60%, airplanes and tanks suffered shortage of fuel, mobility reduced by half.</s>
     <s>The enemy forces were scattered over a too vast area.</s>
     <s>With such scattered deployment, they were unable to cope with the strength of widespread offensive and uprising of the people and army in all battlefields in the South.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>In July 1973, the 21st Conference of the Party Central Committee assessed the situation in South Vietnam after the Paris Agreement, pointing out the mistakes in coping with schemes and acts of sabotage of the enemy, at the same time, confirmed the new tasks of the revolution in the new stage ie to complete the people's national and democratic revolution.</s>
     <s>No matter how the situation was, we had to be firm on the path of revolutionary armed struggle and hold fast to offensive strategy.</s>
     <s>The immediate task of the revolution in the South was to unite all the people, carry out the revolution militarily, politically and diplomatically, compel the enemy to abide by the Paris Agreement and, at the same time, prepare for the possibility of launching offensive to win total victory.</s>
     <s>The tasks of the North were to make use of the current conditions, step up the aid to the revolution in the South, at the same time, rehabilitate and develop the economy in order to turn the socialist North Vietnam into a firm mainstay for the struggle to fulfil independence and democracy in the South and advance to peace and national unification.</s>
     <s>The resolution of the 21st Conference of the Party Central Committee was one of the important instruments to guide the revolution and the revolutionary war to win victory in the final stage of the war.</s>
</p>
<p>
     <s>During the two years 1973-1974, the people and armed forces in the South defeated almost all encroaching operations by the enemy, maintaining and expanding the liberated areas, pushing the enemy into the defensive who had to shrink for the defence of urban areas and important lines of communication.</s>
     <s>Thus, the situation in late 1974 gained fundamental changes.</s>
     <s>Conditions for the total liberation of the South were ripening.</s>
     <s>The armed forces of all the three columns increasingly grew both qualitatively and quantitatively.</s>
     <s>A number of mobile combined arms were set up, serving as crushing blows and spearheads in important strategic areas.</s>
     <s>The armed forces of the South were able not only to defeat the "pacification" plan, but also launch big major campaigns to destroy big enemy corps and liberate vast populated areas in plains and cities.</s>
     <s>Networks of communication lines were widened and lengthened for military campaigns.</s>
     <s>Achievements in restoring the economy in the two years 1973-1974 enabled the people in the North to increase the support of manpower and materials to the South.</s>
     <s> In July 1974 Le Duan, the Party's first general secretary, directly guided the General Staff to work out the strategic plan for the liberation of the South.</s>
     <s>Subsequently, in October and December 1974 and in January 1975, the Politburo of the Party Central Committee was in session, coming to a strategic determination and approving the plan to liberate the South in 1975-1976.</s>
     <s>Besides this plan, the Politburo also calculated another one ie to liberate the South immediately in 1975 if the opportunity was to come.</s>
