        <s id="d1p1s1">A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy.</s>
        <s id="d1p1s2">Hedescribed how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy.</s>
        <s id="d1p1s3">At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up andsaid: "What you have told us is rubbish.</s>
        <s id="d1p1s4">The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a gianttortoise." The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, "What is the tortoise standing on." "You're veryclever, young man, very clever," said the old lady. "But it's turtles all the way down!"</s>

        <s id="d1p2s1">Most people would find the picture of our universe as an infinite tower of tortoises rather ridiculous, but why dowe think we know better? What do we know about the universe, and how do we know it? Where did the universe come from, and where is it going? Did the universe have a beginning, and if so, what happened before then? What is the nature of time? Will it ever come to an end? Can we go back in time? Recent breakthroughsin physics, made possible in part by fantastic new technologies, suggest answers to some of theselongstanding questions.</s>
        <s id="d1p2s2">Someday these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun - orperhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises.</s>
        <s id="d1p2s3">Only time (whatever that may be) will tell.</s>

      <p id="d1p3">
        <s id="d1p3s1">As long ago as 340 BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his book On the Heavens, was able to put forwardtwo good arguments for believing that the earth was a round sphere rather than a Hat plate.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s2">First, he realizedthat eclipses of the moon were caused by the earth coming between the sun and the moon.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s3">The earth'sshadow on the moon was always round, which would be true only if the earth was spherical.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s4">If the earth hadbeen a flat disk, the shadow would have been elongated and elliptical, unless the eclipse always occurred at atime when the sun was directly under the center of the disk.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s5">Second, the Greeks knew from their travels thatthe North Star appeared lower in the sky when viewed in the south than it did in more northerly regions.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s6">(Sincethe North Star lies over the North Pole, it appears to be directly above an observer at the North Pole, but tosomeone looking from the equator, it appears to lie just at the horizon.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s7">From the difference in the apparentposition of the North Star in Egypt and Greece, Aristotle even quoted an estimate that the distance around theearth was 400,000 stadia.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s8">It is not known exactly what length a stadium was, but it may have been about 200yards, which would make Aristotle's estimate about twice the currently accepted figure.</s>
        <s id="d1p3s9">The Greeks even had athird argument that the earth must be round, for why else does one first see the sails of a ship coming over thehorizon, and only later see the hull?</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p4">
        <s id="d1p4s1">Aristotle thought the earth was stationary and that the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars moved incircular orbits about the earth.</s>
        <s id="d1p4s2">He believed this because he felt, for mystical reasons, that the earth was thecenter of the universe, and that circular motion was the most perfect.</s>
        <s id="d1p4s3">This idea was elaborated by Ptolemy inthe second century AD into a complete cosmological model.</s>
        <s id="d1p4s4">The earth stood at the center, surrounded by eightspheres that carried the moon, the sun, the stars, and the five planets known at the time, Mercury, Venus,Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p5">
        <s id="d1p5s1">The planets themselves moved on smaller circles attached to their respective spheres in order to account fortheir rather complicated observed paths in the sky.</s>
        <s id="d1p5s2">The outermost sphere carried the so-called fixed stars,which always stay in the same positions relative to each other but which rotate together across the sky.</s>
        <s id="d1p5s3">Whatlay beyond the last sphere was never made very clear, but it certainly was not part of mankind's observableuniverse.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p6">
        <s id="d1p6s1">Ptolemy's model provided a reasonably accurate system for predicting the positions of heavenly bodies in thesky.</s>
        <s id="d1p6s2">But in order to predict these positions correctly, Ptolemy had to make an assumption that the moonfollowed a path that sometimes brought it twice as close to the earth as at other times.</s>
        <s id="d1p6s3">And that meant that themoon ought sometimes to appear twice as big as at other times! Ptolemy recognized this flaw, but neverthelesshis model was generally, although not universally, accepted.</s>
        <s id="d1p6s4">It was adopted by the Christian church as thepicture of the universe that was in accordance with Scripture, for it had the great advantage that it left lots ofroom outside the sphere of fixed stars for heaven and hell.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p7">
        <s id="d1p7s1">A simpler model, however, was proposed in 1514 by a Polish priest, Nicholas Copernicus.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s2">(At first, perhaps forfear of being branded a heretic by his church, Copernicus circulated his model anonymously.) His idea was thatthe sun was stationary at the center and that the earth and the planets moved in circular orbits around the sun.Nearly a century passed before this idea was taken seriously.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s3">Then two astronomers - the German, Johannes Kepler, and the Italian, Galileo Galilei - started publicly to support the Copernican theory, despite the fact thatthe orbits it predicted did not quite match the ones observed.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s4">The death blow to the Aristotelian/Ptolemaictheory came in 1609.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s5">In that year, Galileo started observing the night sky with a telescope, which had just beeninvented.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s6">When he looked at the planet Jupiter, Galileo found that it was accompanied by several smallsatellites or moons that orbited around it.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s7">This implied that everything did not have to orbit directly around theearth, as Aristotle and Ptolemy had thought.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s8">(It was, of course, still possible to believe that the earth wasstationary at the center of the universe and that the moons of Jupiter moved on extremely complicated pathsaround the earth, giving the appearance that they orbited Jupiter.</s>
        <s id="d1p7s9">However, Copernicus's theory was muchsimpler.) At the same time, Johannes Kepler had modified Copernicus's theory, suggesting that the planetsmoved not in circles but in ellipses (an ellipse is an elongated circle).</s>
        <s id="d1p7s10">The predictions now finally matched theobservations.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p8">
        <s id="d1p8s1">As far as Kepler was concerned, elliptical orbits were merely an ad hoc hypothesis, and a rather repugnant oneat that, because ellipses were clearly less perfect than circles.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s2">Having discovered almost by accident thatelliptical orbits fit the observations well, he could not reconcile them with his idea that the planets were made toorbit the sun by magnetic forces.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s3">An explanation was provided only much later, in 1687, when Sir Isaac Newtonpublished his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, probably the most important single work everpublished in the physical sciences.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s4">In it Newton not only put forward a theory of how bodies move in space andtime, but he also developed the complicated mathematics needed to analyze those motions.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s5">In addition,Newton postulated a law of universal gravitation according to which each body in the universe was attractedtoward every other body by a force that was stronger the more massive the bodies and the closer they were toeach other.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s6">It was this same force that caused objects to fall to the ground.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s7">(The story that Newton was inspiredby an apple hitting his head is almost certainly apocryphal.</s>
        <s id="d1p8s8">All Newton himself ever said was that the idea ofgravity came to him as he sat "in a contemplative mood" and "was occasioned by the fall of an apple.") Newtonwent on to show that, according to his law, gravity causes the moon to move in an elliptical orbit around theearth and causes the earth and the planets to follow elliptical paths around the sun.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p9">
        <s id="d1p9s1">The Copernican model got rid of Ptolemy's celestial spheres, and with them, the idea that the universe had anatural boundary.</s>
        <s id="d1p9s2">Since "fixed stars" did not appear to change their positions apart from a rotation across thesky caused by the earth spinning on its axis, it became natural to suppose that the fixed stars were objects likeour sun but very much farther away.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p10">
        <s id="d1p10s1">Newton realized that, according to his theory of gravity, the stars should attract each other, so it seemed theycould not remain essentially motionless.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s2">Would they not all fall together at some point? In a letter in 1691 toRichard Bentley, another leading thinker of his day, Newton argued that this would indeed happen if there wereonly a finite number of stars distributed over a finite region of space.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s3">But he reasoned that if, on the other hand,there were an infinite number of stars, distributed more or less uniformly over infinite space, this would nothappen, because there would not be any central point for them to fall to.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s4">This argument is an instance of the pitfalls that you can encounter in talking about infinity.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s5">In an infiniteuniverse, every point can be regarded as the center, because every point has an infinite number of stars oneach side of it.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s6">The correct approach, it was realized only much later, is to consider the finite situation, in whichthe stars all fall in on each other, and then to ask how things change if one adds more stars roughly uniformlydistributed outside this region.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s7">According to Newton's law, the extra stars would make no difference at all to theoriginal ones on average, so the stars would fall in just as fast.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s8">We can add as many stars as we like, but theywill still always collapse in on themselves.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s9">We now know it is impossible to have an infinite static model of theuniverse in which gravity is always attractive.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s10">It is an interesting reflection on the general climate of thought before the twentieth century that no one hadsuggested that the universe was expanding or contracting.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s11">It was generally accepted that either the universehad existed forever in an unchanging state, or that it had been created at a finite time in the past more or lessas we observe it today.</s>
        <s id="d1p10s12">In part this may have been due to people's tendency to believe in eternal truths, as wellas the comfort they found in the thought that even though they may grow old and die, the universe is eternaland unchanging.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p11">
        <s id="d1p11s1">Even those who realized that Newton's theory of gravity showed that the universe could not be static did notthink to suggest that it might be expanding.</s>
        <s id="d1p11s2">Instead, they attempted to modify the theory by making the gravitational force repulsive at very large distances.</s>
        <s id="d1p11s3">This did not significantly affect their predictions of themotions of the planets, but it allowed an infinite distribution of stars to remain in equilibrium - with the attractiveforces between nearby stars balanced by the repulsive forces from those that were farther away.</s>
        <s id="d1p11s4">However, wenow believe such an equilibrium would be unstable: if the stars in some region got only slightly nearer eachother, the attractive forces between them would become stronger and dominate over the repulsive forces sothat the stars would continue to fall toward each other.</s>
        <s id="d1p11s5">On the other hand, if the stars got a bit farther awayfrom each other, the repulsive forces would dominate and drive them farther apart.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p12">
        <s id="d1p12s1">Another objection to an infinite static universe is normally ascribed to the German philosopher Heinrich Olbers,who wrote about this theory in 1823.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s2">In fact, various contemporaries of Newton had raised the problem, and theOlbers article was not even the first to contain plausible arguments against it.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s3">It was, however, the first to bewidely noted.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s4">The difficulty is that in an infinite static universe nearly every line of sight would end on thesurface of a star.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s5">Thus one would expect that the whole sky would be as bright as the sun, even at night.Olbers' counter-argument was that the light from distant stars would be dimmed by absorption by interveningmatter.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s6">However, if that happened the intervening matter would eventually heat up until it glowed as brightly asthe stars.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s7">The only way of avoiding the conclusion that the whole of the night sky should be as bright as thesurface of the sun would be to assume that the stars had not been shining forever but had turned on at somefinite time in the past.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s8">In that case the absorbing matter might not have heated up yet or the light from distantstars might not yet have reached us.</s>
        <s id="d1p12s9">And that brings us to the question of what could have caused the stars tohave turned on in the first place.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p13">
        <s id="d1p13s1">The beginning of the universe had, of course, been discussed long before this.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s2">According to a number of earlycosmologies and the Jewish/Christian/Muslim tradition, the universe started at a finite, and not very distant,time in the past.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s3">One argument for such a beginning was the feeling that it was necessary to have "First Cause"to explain the existence of the universe.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s4">(Within the universe, you always explained one event as being causedby some earlier event, but the existence of the universe itself could be explained in this way only if it had somebeginning.) Another argument was put forward by St. Augustine in his book The City of God.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s5">He pointed outthat civilization is progressing and we remember who performed this deed or developed that technique.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s6">Thusman, and so also perhaps the universe, could not have been around all that long.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s7">St. Augustine accepted adate of about 5000 BC for the Creation of the universe according to the book of Genesis.</s>
        <s id="d1p13s8">(It is interesting thatthis is not so far from the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 BC, which is when archaeologists tell us thatcivilization really began.)</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p14">
        <s id="d1p14s1">Aristotle, and most of the other Greek philosophers, on the other hand, did not like the idea of a creationbecause it smacked too much of divine intervention.</s>
        <s id="d1p14s2">They believed, therefore, that the human race and theworld around it had existed, and would exist, forever.</s>
        <s id="d1p14s3">The ancients had already considered the argument aboutprogress described above, and answered it by saying that there had been periodic floods or other disasters thatrepeatedly set the human race right back to the beginning of civilization.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p15">
        <s id="d1p15s1">The questions of whether the universe had a beginning in time and whether it is limited in space were laterextensively examined by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in his monumental (and very obscure) work Critique ofPure Reason, published in 1781.</s>
        <s id="d1p15s2">He called these questions antinomies (that is, contradictions) of pure reasonbecause he felt that there were equally compelling arguments for believing the thesis, that the universe had abeginning, and the antithesis, that it had existed forever.</s>
        <s id="d1p15s3">His argument for the thesis was that if the universe didnot have a beginning, there would be an infinite period of time before any event, which he considered absurd.The argument for the antithesis was that if the universe had a beginning, there would be an infinite period oftime before it, so why should the universe begin at any one particular time? In fact, his cases for both the thesisand the antithesis are really the same argument.</s>
        <s id="d1p15s4">They are both based on his unspoken assumption that timecontinues back forever, whether or not the universe had existed forever.</s>
        <s id="d1p15s5">As we shall see, the concept of timehas no meaning before the beginning of the universe.</s>
        <s id="d1p15s6">This was first pointed out by St. Augustine.</s>
        <s id="d1p15s7">When asked:"What did God do before he created the universe?" Augustine didn't reply: "He was preparing Hell for peoplewho asked such questions." Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, andthat time did not exist before the beginning of the universe.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p16">
        <s id="d1p16s1">When most people believed in an essentially static and unchanging universe, the question of whether or not ithad a beginning was really one of metaphysics or theology.</s>
        <s id="d1p16s2">One could account for what was observed equallywell on the theory that the universe had existed forever or on the theory that it was set in motion at some finite time in such a manner as to look as though it had existed forever.</s>
        <s id="d1p16s3">But in 1929, Edwin Hubble made thelandmark observation that wherever you look, distant galaxies are moving rapidly away from us.</s>
        <s id="d1p16s4">In other words,the universe is expanding.</s>
        <s id="d1p16s5">This means that at earlier times objects would have been closer together.</s>
        <s id="d1p16s6">In fact, itseemed that there was a time, about ten or twenty thousand million years ago, when they were all at exactlythe same place and when, therefore, the density of the universe was infinite.</s>
        <s id="d1p16s7">This discovery finally brought thequestion of the beginning of the universe into the realm of science.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p17">
        <s id="d1p17s1">Hubble's observations suggested that there was a time, called the big bang, when the universe wasinfinitesimally small and infinitely dense.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s2">Under such conditions all the laws of science, and therefore all abilityto predict the future, would break down.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s3">If there were events earlier than this time, then they could not affectwhat happens at the present time.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s4">Their existence can be ignored because it would have no observationalconsequences.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s5">One may say that time had a beginning at the big bang, in the sense that earlier times simplywould not be defined.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s6">It should be emphasized that this beginning in time is very different from those that hadbeen considered previously.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s7">In an unchanging universe a beginning in time is something that has to beimposed by some being outside the universe; there is no physical necessity for a beginning.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s8">One can imaginethat God created the universe at literally any time in the past.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s9">On the other hand, if the universe is expanding,there may be physical reasons why there had to be a beginning.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s10">One could still imagine that God created theuniverse at the instant of the big bang, or even afterwards in just such a way as to make it look as though therehad been a big bang, but it would be meaningless to suppose that it was created before the big bang.</s>
        <s id="d1p17s11">Anexpanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job!</s>

      <p id="d1p18">
        <s id="d1p18s1">In order to talk about the nature of the universe and to discuss questions such as whether it has a beginning oran end, you have to be clear about what a scientific theory is.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s2">I shall take the simpleminded view that a theoryis just a model of the universe, or a restricted part of it, and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model toobservations that we make.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s3">It exists only in our minds and does not have any other reality (whatever that mightmean).</s>
        <s id="d1p18s4">A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s5">It must accurately describe a large class ofobservations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definitepredictions about the results of future observations.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s6">For example, Aristotle believed Empedocles's theory thateverything was made out of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s7">This was simple enough, but did not makeany definite predictions.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s8">On the other hand, Newton's theory of gravity was based on an even simpler model, inwhich bodies attracted each other with a force that was proportional to a quantity called their mass andinversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</s>
        <s id="d1p18s9">Yet it predicts the motions of the sun, themoon, and the planets to a high degree of accuracy.</s>

        <s id="d1p19s3">On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even asingle observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory.</s>
        <s id="d1p19s4">As philosopher of science Karl Popper hasemphasized, a good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could inprinciple be disproved or falsified by observation.</s>
        <s id="d1p19s5">Each time new experiments are observed to agree with thepredictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found todisagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory.</s>

      <p id="d1p20">
        <s id="d1p20s1">In practice, what often happens is that a new theory is devised that is really an extension of the previous theory.For example, very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motionand the predictions of Newton's theory of gravity.</s>

        <s id="d1p20s3">The fact that Einstein's predictions matched what was seen, whileNewton's did not, was one of the crucial confirmations of the new theory.</s>
        <s id="d1p20s4">However, we still use Newton's theoryfor all practical purposes because the difference between its predictions and those of general relativity is verysmall in the situations that we normally deal with.</s>

        <s id="d1p21s2">However, the approach most scientists actually follow is to separate the problem into two parts.</s>
        <s id="d1p21s3">First, there are the laws thattell us how the universe changes with time.</s>
        <s id="d1p21s4">(If we know what the universe is like at any one time, these physicallaws tell us how it will look at any later time.) Second, there is the question of the initial state of the universe.Some people feel that science should be concerned with only the first part; they regard the question of theinitial situation as a matter for metaphysics or religion.</s>
        <s id="d1p21s5">They would say that God, being omnipotent, could havestarted the universe off any way he wanted.</s>
        <s id="d1p21s6">That may be so, but in that case he also could have made itdevelop in a completely arbitrary way.</s>
        <s id="d1p21s7">Yet it appears that he chose to make it evolve in a very regular wayaccording to certain laws.</s>
        <s id="d1p21s8">It therefore seems equally reasonable to suppose that there are also laws governingthe initial state.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d1p22">
        <s id="d1p22s1">It turns out to be very difficult to devise a theory to describe the universe all in one go.</s>
        <s id="d1p22s2">Instead, we break theproblem up into bits and invent a number of partial theories.</s>

        <s id="d5p13s3">Gravity is the weakest of the four forces by a long way; it is so weak that we would notnotice it at all were it not for two special properties that it has: it can act over large distances, and it is always attractive.</s>
        <s id="d5p13s4">This means that the very weak gravitational forces between the individual particles in two large bodies, such as the earthand the sun, can all add up to produce a significant force.</s>
        <s id="d5p13s5">The other three forces are either short range, or are sometimesattractive and some-times repulsive, so they tend to cancel out.</s>
        <s id="d5p13s6">In the quantum mechanical way of looking at thegravitational field, the force between two matter particles is pictured as being carried by a particle of spin 2 called thegraviton.</s>

        <s id="d5p13s9">Although theexchanged particles are virtual, they certainly do produce a measurable effect - they make the earth orbit the sun! Realgravitons make up what classical physicists would call gravitational waves, which are very weak - and so difficult todetect that they have not yet been observed.</s>

      <p id="d5p14">
        <s id="d5p14s1">The next category is the electromagnetic force, which interacts with electrically charged particles like electrons andquarks, but not with uncharged particles such as gravitons.</s>
        <s id="d5p14s2">It is much stronger than the gravitational force: theelectromagnetic force between two electrons is about a million million million million million million million (1 with forty-twozeros after it) times bigger than the gravitational force.</s>
        <s id="d5p14s3">However, there are two kinds of electric charge, positive andnegative.</s>

        <s id="d5p14s8">The electromagnetic attraction between negatively charged electronsand positively charged protons in the nucleus causes the electrons to orbit the nucleus of the atom, just as gravitationalattraction causes the earth to orbit the sun.</s>
        <s id="d5p14s9">The electromagnetic attraction is pictured as being caused by the exchangeof large numbers of virtual massless particles of spin 1, called photons.</s>
        <s id="d5p14s10">Again, the photons that are exchanged are virtualparticles.</s>
        <s id="d5p14s11">However, when an electron changes from one allowed orbit to another one nearer to the nucleus, energy isreleased and a real photon is emitted - which can be observed as visible light by the human eye, if it has the rightwave-length, or by a photon detector such as photographic film.</s>
        <s id="d5p14s12">Equally, if a real photon collides with an atom, it maymove an electron from an orbit nearer the nucleus to one farther away.</s>

But if these light rays were swallowed upby the black hole, then they could not have been on the boundary of the black hole.</s>
        <s id="d7p2s4">So the paths of light rays in the event horizon had always to be moving parallel to, or away from, each other.</s>

        <s id="d7p6s1">A precise statement of this idea is known as the second law of thermodynamics.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s2">It states that the entropy of an isolatedsystem always increases, and that when two systems are joined together, the entropy of the combined system isgreater than the sum of the entropies of the individual systems.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s3">For example, consider a system of gas molecules in abox.</s>

        <s id="d7p6s5">The higher the temperature of the gas, the faster the molecules move, and so the more frequently andharder they collide with the walls of the box and the greater the outward pressure they exert on the walls.</s>

        <s id="d7p6s9">Such a state is less ordered, or more disordered, than the original state in which all the molecules werein one half.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s10">One therefore says that the entropy of the gas has gone up.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s11">Similarly, suppose one starts with two boxes,one containing oxygen molecules and the other containing nitrogen molecules.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s12">If one joins the boxes together andremoves the intervening wall, the oxygen and the nitrogen molecules will start to mix.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s13">At a later time the most probablestate would be a fairly uniform mixture of oxygen and nitrogen molecules throughout the two boxes.</s>
        <s id="d7p6s14">This state wouldbe less ordered, and hence have more entropy, than the initial state of two separate boxes.</s>

      <p id="d7p7">
        <s id="d7p7s1">The second law of thermodynamics has a rather different status than that of other laws of science, such as Newton'slaw of gravity, for example, because it does not hold always, just in the vast majority of cases.</s>
        <s id="d7p7s2">The probability of all thegas molecules in our first box found in one half of the box at a later time is many millions of millions to one, but it can happen.</s>

        <s id="d7p7s5">One could, of course, still say that the total entropy, including the entropy inside the black hole, has not gonedown - but since there is no way to look inside the black hole, we cannot see how much entropy the matter inside ithas.</s>
        <s id="d7p7s6">It would be nice, then, if there was some feature of the black hole by which observers outside the black hole couldtell its entropy, and which would increase whenever matter carrying entropy fell into the black hole.</s>
        <s id="d7p7s7">Following thediscovery, described above, that the area of the event horizon increased whenever matter fell into a black hole, aresearch student at Princeton named Jacob Bekenstein suggested that the area of the event horizon was a measure ofthe entropy of the black hole.</s>

        <s id="d7p8s1">This suggestion seemed to prevent the second law of thermodynamics from being violated in most situations.However, there was one fatal flaw.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s2">If a black hole has entropy, then it ought to also have a temperature.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s3">But a bodywith a particular temperature must emit radiation at a certain rate.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s4">It is a matter of common experience that if one heatsup a poker in a fire it glows red hot and emits radiation, but bodies at lower temperatures emit radiation too; one justdoes not normally notice it because the amount is fairly small.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s5">This radiation is required in order to prevent violation ofthe second law.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s6">So black holes ought to emit radiation.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s7">But by their very definition, black holes are objects that are notsupposed to emit anything.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s8">It therefore seemed that the area of the event horizon of a black hole could not be regardedas its entropy.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s9">In 1972 I wrote a paper with Brandon Carter and an American colleague, Jim Bardeen, in which wepointed out that although there were many similarities between entropy and the area of the event horizon, there wasthis apparently fatal difficulty.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s10">I must admit that in writing this paper I was motivated partly by irritation with Bekenstein,who, I felt, had misused my discovery of the increase of the area of the event horizon.</s>
        <s id="d7p8s11">However, it turned out in the endthat he was basically correct, though in a manner he had certainly not expected.</s>

      <p id="d7p9">
        <s id="d7p9s1">In September 1973, while I was visiting Moscow, I discussed black holes with two leading Soviet experts, YakovZeldovich and Alexander Starobinsky.</s>

        <s id="d7p9s4">I therefore set about devising a bettermathematical treatment, which I described at an informal seminar in Oxford at the end of November 1973.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s5">At that time I had not done the calculations to find out how much would actually be emitted.</s>

        <s id="d7p9s7">However, when I did the calculation, I found, to my surprise and annoyance, that even non-rotating black holes should apparently create and emit particles ata steady rate.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s8">At first I thought that this emission indicated that one of the approximations I had used was not valid.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s9">Iwas afraid that if Bekenstein found out about it, he would use it as a further argument to support his ideas about theentropy of black holes, which I still did not like.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s10">However, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed that theapproximations really ought to hold.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s11">But what finally convinced me that the emission was real was that the spectrum ofthe emitted particles was exactly that which would be emitted by a hot body, and that the black hole was emittingparticles at exactly the correct rate to prevent violations of the second law.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s12">Since then the calculations have beenrepeated in a number of different forms by other people.</s>
        <s id="d7p9s13">They all confirm that a black hole ought to emit particles andradiation as if it were a hot body with a temperature that depends only on the black hole's mass: the higher the mass,the lower the temperature.</s>

      <p id="d7p10">
        <s id="d7p10s1">How is it possible that a black hole appears to emit particles when we know that nothing can escape from within itsevent horizon? The answer, quantum theory tells us, is that the particles do not come from within the black hole, butfrom the "empty" space just outside the black hole's event horizon! We can understand this in the following way: whatwe think of as "empty" space cannot be completely empty because that would mean that all the fields, such as thegravitational and electromagnetic fields, would have to be exactly zero.</s>
        <s id="d7p10s2">However, the value of a field and its rate ofchange with time are like the position and velocity of a particle: the uncertainty principle implies that the moreaccurately one knows one of these quantities, the less accurately one can know the other.</s>
        <s id="d7p10s3">So in empty space the fieldcannot be fixed at exactly zero, because then it would have both a precise value (zero) and a precise rate of change(also zero).</s>
        <s id="d7p10s4">There must be a certain minimum amount of uncertainty, or quantum fluctuations, in the value of the field.One can think of these fluctuations as pairs of particles of light or gravity that appear together at some time, moveapart, and then come together again and annihilate each other.</s>
        <s id="d7p10s5">These particles are virtual particles like the particlesthat carry the gravitational force of the sun: unlike real particles, they cannot be observed directly with a particledetector.</s>
        <s id="d7p10s6">However, their indirect effects, such as small changes in the energy of electron orbits in atoms, can bemeasured and agree with the theoretical predictions to a remarkable degree of accuracy.</s>
        <s id="d7p10s7">The uncertainty principle alsopredicts that there will be similar virtual pairs of matter particles, such as electrons or quarks.</s>
        <s id="d7p10s8">In this case, however,one member of the pair will be a particle and the other an antiparticle (the antiparticles of light and gravity are the sameas the particles).</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d7p11">
        <s id="d7p11s1">Because energy cannot be created out of nothing, one of the partners in a particle/antiparticle pair will have positiveenergy, and the other partner negative energy.</s>
        <s id="d7p11s2">The one with negative energy is condemned to be a short-lived virtualparticle because real particles always have positive energy in normal situations.</s>
        <s id="d7p11s3">It must therefore seek out its partnerand annihilate with it.</s>
        <s id="d7p11s4">However, a real particle close to a massive body has less energy than if it were far away,because it would take energy to lift it far away against the gravitational attraction of the body.</s>
        <s id="d7p11s5">Normally, the energy ofthe particle is still positive, but the gravitational field inside a black hole is so strong that even a real particle can havenegative energy there.</s>

        <s id="d7p11s7">In this case it no longer has to annihilate with itspartner.</s>
        <s id="d7p11s8">Its forsaken partner may fall into the black hole as well.</s>

        <s id="d7p12s2">The smaller the black hole, theshorter the distance the particle with negative energy will have to go before it becomes a real particle, and thus thegreater the rate of emission, and the apparent temperature, of the black hole.</s>

        <s id="d7p13s4">As the black hole loses mass, thearea of its event horizon gets smaller, but this decrease in the entropy of the black hole is more than compensated forby the entropy of the emitted radiation, so the second law is never violated.</s>

      <p id="d11p1">
        <s id="d11p1s1">As was explained in the first chapter, it would be very difficult to construct a complete unified theory ofeverything in the universe all at one go.</s>
        <s id="d11p1s2">So instead we have made progress by finding partial theories thatdescribe a limited range of happenings and by neglecting other effects or approximating them by certainnumbers.</s>
        <s id="d11p1s3">(Chemistry, for example, allows us to calculate the interactions of atoms, without knowing the internalstructure of an atom's nucleus.) Ultimately, however, one would hope to find a complete, consistent, unifiedtheory that would include all these partial theories as approximations, and that did not need to be adjusted to fitthe facts by picking the values of certain arbitrary numbers in the theory.</s>
        <s id="d11p1s4">The quest for such a theory is knownas "the unification of physics." Einstein spent most of his later years unsuccessfully searching for a unifiedtheory, but the time was not ripe: there were partial theories for gravity and the electromagnetic force, but verylittle was known about the nuclear forces.</s>
        <s id="d11p1s5">Moreover, Einstein refused to believe in the reality of quantummechanics, despite the important role he had played in its development.</s>
        <s id="d11p1s6">Yet it seems that the uncertaintyprinciple is a fundamental feature of the universe we live in.</s>
        <s id="d11p1s7">A successful unified theory must, therefore,necessarily incorporate this principle.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p2">
        <s id="d11p2s1">As I shall describe, the prospects for finding such a theory seem to be much better now because we know somuch more about the universe.</s>
        <s id="d11p2s2">But we must beware of overconfidence - we have had false dawns before! At the beginning of this century, for example, it was thought that everything could be explained in terms of theproperties of continuous matter, such as elasticity and heat conduction.</s>
        <s id="d11p2s3">The discovery of atomic structure andthe uncertainty principle put an emphatic end to that.</s>
        <s id="d11p2s4">Then again, in 1928, physicist and Nobel Prize winnerMax Born told a group of visitors to Gottingen University, "Physics, as we know it, will be over in six months."His confidence was based on the recent discovery by Dirac of the equation that governed the electron.</s>
        <s id="d11p2s5">It wasthought that a similar equation would govern the proton, which was the only other particle known at the time,and that would be the end of theoretical physics.</s>
        <s id="d11p2s6">However, the discovery of the neutron and of nuclear forcesknocked that one on the head too.</s>
        <s id="d11p2s7">Having said this, I still believe there are grounds for cautious optimism thatwe may now be near the end of the search for the ultimate laws of nature.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p3">
        <s id="d11p3s1">In previous chapters I have described general relativity, the partial theory of gravity, and the partial theories thatgovern the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic forces.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s2">The last three may be combined in so-calledgrand unified theories, or GUTs, which are not very satisfactory because they do not include gravity andbecause they contain a number of quantities, like the relative masses of different particles, that cannot bepredicted from the theory but have to be chosen to fit observations.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s3">The main difficulty in finding a theory thatunifies gravity with the other forces is that general relativity is a "classical" theory; that is, it does not incorporatethe uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s4">On the other hand, the other partial theories depend onquantum mechanics in an essential way.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s5">A necessary first step, therefore, is to combine general relativity withthe uncertainty principle.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s6">As we have seen, this can produce some remarkable consequences, such as blackholes not being black, and the universe not having any singularities but being completely self-contained andwithout a boundary.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s7">The trouble is, as explained in Chapter 7, that the uncertainty principle means that even"empty" space is filled with pairs of virtual particles and antiparticles.</s>
        <s id="d11p3s8">These pairs would have an infinite amount of energy and, therefore, by Einstein's famous equation E = mc2, they would have an infinite amount of mass.Their gravitational attraction would thus curve up the universe to infinitely small size.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p4">
        <s id="d11p4s1">Rather similar, seemingly absurd infinities occur in the other partial theories, but in all these cases the infinitiescan be canceled out by a process called renormalization.</s>
        <s id="d11p4s2">This involves canceling the infinities by introducingother infinities.</s>
        <s id="d11p4s3">Although this technique is rather dubious mathematically, it does seem to work in practice, andhas been used with these theories to make predictions that agree with observations to an extraordinary degreeof accuracy.</s>
        <s id="d11p4s4">Renormalization, however, does have a serious drawback from the point of view of trying to find acomplete theory, because it means that the actual values of the masses and the strengths of the forces cannotbe predicted from the theory, but have to be chosen to fit the observations.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p5">
        <s id="d11p5s1">In attempting to incorporate the uncertainty principle into general relativity, one has only two quantities that canbe adjusted: the strength of gravity and the value of the cosmological constant.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s2">But adjusting these is not sufficient to remove all the infinities.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s3">One therefore has a theory that seems to predict that certain quantities,such as the curvature of space-time, are really infinite, yet these quantities can be observed and measured tobe perfectly finite! This problem in combining general relativity and the uncertainty principle had beensuspected for some time, but was finally confirmed by detailed calculations in 1972.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s4">Four years later, a possiblesolution, called "supergravity," was suggested.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s5">The idea was to combine the spin-2 particle called the graviton,which carries the gravitational force, with certain other particles of spin 3/2, 1, 12, and 0.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s6">In a sense, all theseparticles could then be regarded as different aspects of the same "superparticle," thus unifying the matterparticles with spin 12 and 3/2 with the force-carrying particles of spin 0, 1, and 2.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s7">The virtual particle/antiparticlepairs of spin 12 and 3/2 would have negative energy, and so would tend to cancel out the positive energy of thespin 2, 1, and 0 virtual pairs.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s8">This would cause many of the possible infinities to cancel out, but it wassuspected that some infinities might still remain.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s9">However, the calculations required to find out whether or notthere were any infinities left uncancelled were so long and difficult that no one was prepared to undertake them.Even with a computer it was reckoned it would take at least four years, and the chances were very high thatone would make at least one mistake, probably more.</s>
        <s id="d11p5s10">So one would know one had the right answer only ifsomeone else repeated the calculation and got the same answer, and that did not seem very likely!</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p6">
        <s id="d11p6s1">Despite these problems, and the fact that the particles in the super-gravity theories did not seem to match the observed particles, most scientists belived that super-gravity was probably the right answer to the problem of the unification of physics.</s>
        <s id="d11p6s2">It seemed the best way if unifing gravity with the other forces.</s>
        <s id="d11p6s3">However, in 1984 there was a remarkable change of opinion in favor of what are called string theories.</s>
        <s id="d11p6s4">In these theories the basic objects are not particles, which occupy a single point of space, but things that have a length but no other dimension, like an infinitely thin piece of string.</s>
        <s id="d11p6s5">These strings may have ends (the so-called open strings) or they may be joined up with themselves in closed loops (closed strings) Figure 11:1 and Figure 11:2.</s>

      <p id="d11p7">
        <s id="d11p7s1">A particle occupies one point of space at each instant of time.</s>
        <s id="d11p7s2">Thus its history can be represented by a line inspace-time (the "world-line").</s>
        <s id="d11p7s3">A string, on the other hand, occupies a line in space at each moment of time.</s>
        <s id="d11p7s4">Soits history in space-time is a two-dimensional surface called the world-sheet.</s>
        <s id="d11p7s5">(Any point on such a world-sheetcan be described by two numbers, one specifying the time and the other the position of the point on the string.)The world-sheet of an open string is a strip: its edges represent the paths through space-time of the ends of thestring Figure 11:1.</s>
        <s id="d11p7s6">The world-sheet of a closed string is a cylinder or tube Figure 11:2: a slice through the tubeis a circle, which represents the position of the string at one particular time.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p8">
        <s id="d11p8s1">Two pieces of string can join together to form a single string; in the case of open strings they simply join at theends Figure 11:3, while in the case of closed strings it is like the two legs joining on a pair of trousers Figure11:4.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p9">
        <s id="d11p9s1">Similarly, a single piece of string can divide into two strings.</s>
        <s id="d11p9s2">In string theories, what were previously thought ofas particles are now pictured as waves traveling down the string, like waves on a vibrating kite string.</s>
        <s id="d11p9s3">Theemission or absorption of one particle by another corresponds to the dividing or joining together of strings.</s>
        <s id="d11p9s4">Forexample, the gravitational force of the sun on the earth was pictured in particle theories as being caused by theemission of a graviton by a particle in the sun and its absorption by a particle in the earth Figure 11:5.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p10">
        <s id="d11p10s1">In string theory, this process corresponds to an H-shaped tube or pipe Figure 11:6 (string theory is rather likeplumbing, in a way).</s>
        <s id="d11p10s2">The two vertical sides of the H correspond to the particles in the sun and the earth, and thehorizontal crossbar corresponds to the graviton that travels between them.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p11">
        <s id="d11p11s1">String theory has a curious history.</s>
        <s id="d11p11s2">It was originally invented in the late 1960s in an attempt to find a theory todescribe the strong force.</s>
        <s id="d11p11s3">The idea was that particles like the proton and the neutron could be regarded aswaves on a string.</s>
        <s id="d11p11s4">The strong forces between the particles would correspond to pieces of string that wentbetween other bits of string, as in a spider's web.</s>
        <s id="d11p11s5">For this theory to give the observed value of the strong forcebetween particles, the strings had to be like rubber bands with a pull of about ten tons.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p12">
        <s id="d11p12s1">In 1974 Joel Scherk from Paris and John Schwarz from the California Institute of Technology published a paperin which they showed that string theory could describe the gravitational force, but only if the tension in the stringwere very much higher, about a thousand million million million million million million tons (1 with thirty-ninezeros after it).</s>
        <s id="d11p12s2">The predictions of the string theory would be just the same as those of general relativity onnormal length scales, but they would differ at very small distances, less than a thousand million million millionmillion millionth of a centimeter (a centimeter divided by 1 with thirty-three zeros after it).</s>
        <s id="d11p12s3">Their work did notreceive much attention, however, because at just about that time most people abandoned the original stringtheory of the strong force in favor of the theory based on quarks and gluons, which seemed to fit much betterwith observations.</s>
        <s id="d11p12s4">Scherk died in tragic circumstances (he suffered from diabetes and went into a coma whenno one was around to give him an injection of insulin).</s>
        <s id="d11p12s5">So Schwarz was left alone as almost the only supporterof string theory, but now with the much higher proposed value of the string tension.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p13">
        <s id="d11p13s1">In 1984 interest in strings suddenly revived, apparently for two reasons.</s>
        <s id="d11p13s2">One was that people were not reallymaking much progress toward showing that supergravity was finite or that it could explain the kinds of particlesthat we observe.</s>
        <s id="d11p13s3">The other was the publication of a paper by John Schwarz and Mike Green of Queen MaryCollege, London, that showed that string theory might be able to explain the existence of particles that have abuilt-in left-handedness, like some of the particles that we observe.</s>
        <s id="d11p13s4">Whatever the reasons, a large number ofpeople soon began to work on string theory and a new version was developed, the so-called heterotic string,which seemed as if it might be able to explain the types of particles that we observe.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p14">
        <s id="d11p14s1">String theories also lead to infinities, but it is thought they will all cancel out in versions like the heterotic string (though this is not yet known for certain).</s>
        <s id="d11p14s2">String theories, however, have a bigger problem: they seem to beconsistent only if space-time has either ten or twenty-six dimensions, instead of the usual four! Of course, extraspace-time dimensions are a commonplace of science fiction indeed, they provide an ideal way of overcomingthe normal restriction of general relativity that one cannot travel faster than light or back in time (see Chapter10).</s>
        <s id="d11p14s3">The idea is to take a shortcut through the extra dimensions.</s>
        <s id="d11p14s4">One can picture this in the following way.Imagine that the space we live in has only two dimensions and is curved like the surface of an anchor ring or torus Figure 11:7.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p15">
        <s id="d11p15s1">If you were on one side of the inside edge of the ring and you wanted to get to a point on the other side, youwould have to go round the inner edge of the ring.</s>
        <s id="d11p15s2">However, if you were able to travel in the third dimension,you could cut straight across.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p16">
        <s id="d11p16s1">Why don't we notice all these extra dimensions, if they are really there? Why do we see only three spacedimensions and one time dimension? The suggestion is that the other dimensions are curved up into a space ofvery small size, something like a million million million million millionth of an inch.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s2">This is so small that we justdon't notice it: we see only one time dimension and three space dimensions, in which space-time is fairly flat.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s3">Itis like the surface of a straw.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s4">If you look at it closely, you see it is two-dimensional (the position of a point on thestraw is described by two numbers, the length along the straw and the distance round the circular direction).But if you look at it from a distance, you don't see the thickness of the straw and it looks one-dimensional (theposition of a point is specified only by the length along the straw).</s>
        <s id="d11p16s5">So it is with space-time: on a very small scaleit is ten-dimensional and highly curved, but on bigger scales you don't see the curvature or the extradimensions.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s6">If this picture is correct, it spells bad news for would-be space travelers: the extra dimensionswould be far too small to allow a spaceship through.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s7">However, it raises another major problem.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s8">Why shouldsome, but not all, of the dimensions be curled up into a small ball? Presumably, in the very early universe allthe dimensions would have been very curved.</s>
        <s id="d11p16s9">Why did one time dimension and three space dimensions flatten out, while the other dimensions remain tightly curled up?</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p17">
        <s id="d11p17s1">One possible answer is the anthropic principle.</s>
        <s id="d11p17s2">Two space dimensions do not seem to be enough to allow forthe development of complicated beings like us.</s>
        <s id="d11p17s3">For example, two-dimensional animals living on aone-dimensional earth would have to climb over each other in order to get past each other.</s>
        <s id="d11p17s4">If a two-dimensionalcreature ate something it could not digest completely, it would have to bring up the remains the same way itswallowed them, because if there were a passage right through its body, it would divide the creature into twoseparate halves: our two-dimensional being would fall apart Figure 11:8.</s>
        <s id="d11p17s5">Similarly, it is difficult to see how therecould be any circulation of the blood in a two-dimensional creature.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p18">
        <s id="d11p18s1">There would also be problems with more than three space dimensions.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s2">The gravitational force between twobodies would decrease more rapidly with distance than it does in three dimensions.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s3">(In three dimensions, thegravitational force drops to 1/4 if one doubles the distance.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s4">In four dimensions it would drop to 1/5, in fivedimensions to 1/6, and so on.) The significance of this is that the orbits of planets, like the earth, around the sunwould be unstable: the least disturbance from a circular orbit (such as would be caused by the gravitationalattraction of other planets) would result in the earth spiraling away from or into the sun.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s5">We would either freezeor be burned up.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s6">In fact, the same behavior of gravity with distance in more than three space dimensionsmeans that the sun would not be able to exist in a stable state with pressure balancing gravity.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s7">It would eitherfall apart or it would collapse to form a black hole.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s8">In either case, it would not be of much use as a source ofheat and light for life on earth.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s9">On a smaller scale, the electrical forces that cause the electrons to orbit roundthe nucleus in an atom would behave in the same way as gravitational forces.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s10">Thus the electrons would eitherescape from the atom altogether or would spiral into the nucleus.</s>
        <s id="d11p18s11">In either case, one could not have atoms aswe know them.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p19">
        <s id="d11p19s1">It seems clear then that life, at least as we know it, can exist only in regions of space-time in which one timedimension and three space dimensions are not curled up small.</s>
        <s id="d11p19s2">This would mean that one could appeal to theweak anthropic principle, provided one could show that string theory does at least allow there to be suchregions of the universe - and it seems that indeed string theory does.</s>
        <s id="d11p19s3">There may well be other regions of theuniverse, or other universes (whatever that may mean), in which all the dimensions are curled up small or inwhich more than four dimensions are nearly flat, but there would be no intelligent beings in such regions to observe the different number of effective dimensions.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d11p20">
        <s id="d11p20s1">Another problem is that there are at least four different string theories (open strings and three different closedstring theories) and millions of ways in which the extra dimensions predicted by string theory could be curledup.</s>
        <s id="d11p20s2">Why should just one string theory and one kind of curling up be picked out? For a time there seemed noanswer, and progress got bogged down.</s>
        <s id="d11p20s3">Then, from about 1994, people started discovering what are calleddualities: different string theories and different ways of curling up the extra dimensions could lead to the sameresults in four dimensions.</s>
        <s id="d11p20s4">Moreover, as well as particles, which occupy a single point of space, and strings,which are lines, there were found to be other objects called p-branes, which occupied two-dimensional orhigher-dimensional volumes in space.</s>

        <s id="d13p2s2">His advocacy of civil disobedience and public encouragement of people to refuse conscription did little to endearhim to his colleagues.</s>
        <s id="d13p2s3">Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improvinginternational relations.</s>
        <s id="d13p2s4">This too did not make him popular, and soon his politics were making it difficult for him tovisit the United States, even to give lectures.</s>

      <p id="d13p3">
        <s id="d13p3s1">Einstein's second great cause was Zionism.</s>
        <s id="d13p3s2">Although he was Jewish by descent, Einstein rejected the biblicalidea of God.</s>
        <s id="d13p3s3">However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism, both before and during the First World War, ledhim gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism.Once more unpopularity did not stop him from speaking his mind.</s>
        <s id="d13p3s4">His theories came under attack; ananti-Einstein organization was even set up.</s>
        <s id="d13p3s5">One man was convicted of inciting others to murder Einstein (andfined a mere six dollars).</s>
        <s id="d13p3s6">But Einstein was phlegmatic.</s>
        <s id="d13p3s7">When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, "If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!"</s>

        <s id="d13p4s1">In 1933, Hitler came to power.</s>
        <s id="d13p4s2">Einstein was in America, and declared he would not return to Germany.</s>
        <s id="d13p4s3">Then,while Nazi militia raided his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed theheadline "Good News from Einstein - He's Not Coming Back." In the face of the Nazi threat, Einsteinrenounced pacifism, and eventually, fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, proposed thatthe United States should develop its own.</s>
        <s id="d13p4s4">But even before the first atomic bomb had been detonated, he waspublicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry.</s>

      <p id="d13p5">
        <s id="d13p5s1">Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little that would last - and certainly wonhim few friends.</s>
        <s id="d13p5s2">His vocal support of the Zionist cause, however, was duly recognized in 1952, when he wasoffered the presidency of Israel.</s>
        <s id="d13p5s3">He declined, saying he thought he was too naive in politics.</s>
        <s id="d13p5s4">But perhaps hisreal reason was different: to quote him again, "Equations are more important to me, because politics is for thepresent, but an equation is something for eternity."</s>

        <s id="d14p1s1">Isaac Newton was not a pleasant man.</s>
        <s id="d14p1s2">His relations with other academics were notorious, with most of his laterlife spent embroiled in heated disputes.</s>
        <s id="d14p1s3">Following publication of Principia Mathematica - surely the mostinfluential book ever written in physics - Newton had risen rapidly into public prominence.</s>
        <s id="d14p1s4">He was appointedpresident of the Royal Society and became the first scientist ever to be knighted.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d14p2">
        <s id="d14p2s1">Newton soon clashed with the Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, who had earlier provided Newton withmuch-needed data for Principia, but was now withholding information that Newton wanted.</s>
        <s id="d14p2s2">Newton would nottake no for an answer: he had himself appointed to the governing body of the Royal Observatory and then triedto force immediate publication of the data.</s>
        <s id="d14p2s3">Eventually he arranged for Flamsteed's work to be seized andprepared for publication by Flamsteed's mortal enemy, Edmond Halley.</s>
        <s id="d14p2s4">But Flamsteed took the case to courtand, in the nick of time, won a court order preventing distribution of the stolen work.</s>
        <s id="d14p2s5">Newton was incensed andsought his revenge by systematically deleting all references to Flamsteed in later editions of Principia.</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d14p3">
        <s id="d14p3s1">A more serious dispute arose with the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz.</s>
        <s id="d14p3s2">Both Leibniz and Newton hadindependently developed a branch of mathematics called calculus, which underlies most of modern physics.Although we now know that Newton discovered calculus years before Leibniz, he published his work muchlater.</s>
        <s id="d14p3s3">A major row ensued over who had been first, with scientists vigorously defending both contenders.</s>
        <s id="d14p3s4">It isremarkable, however, that most of the articles appearing in defense of Newton were originally written by hisown hand - and only published in the name of friends! As the row grew, Leibniz made the mistake of appealingto the Royal Society to resolve the dispute.</s>
        <s id="d14p3s5">Newton, as president, appointed an "impartial" committee toinvestigate, coincidentally consisting entirely of Newton's friends! But that was not all: Newton then wrote thecommittee's report himself and had the Royal Society publish it, officially accusing Leibniz of plagiarism.</s>
        <s id="d14p3s6">Stillunsatisfied, he then wrote an anonymous review of the report in the Royal Society's own periodical.</s>
        <s id="d14p3s7">Followingthe death of Leibniz, Newton is reported to have declared that he had taken great satisfaction in "breakingLeibniz's heart."</s>
      </p>
      <p id="d14p4">
        <s id="d14p4s1">During the period of these two disputes, Newton had already left Cambridge and academe.</s>
        <s id="d14p4s2">He had been activein anti-Catholic politics at Cambridge, and later in Parliament, and was rewarded eventually with the lucrativepost of Warden of the Royal Mint.</s>
        <s id="d14p4s3">Here he used his talents for deviousness and vitriol in a more sociallyacceptable way, successfully conducting a major campaign against counterfeiting, even sending several men totheir death on the gallows.</s>
