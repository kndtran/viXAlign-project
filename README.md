# Ha-viXAlign
This is the second release of a Vietnamese text processing toolkit, which is called "viXAlign", 
developed by [Nguyen Tien Ha - Nguyen Thi Minh Huyen - Nguyen Minh Hai] at College of Sciences, Vietnam National University in Hanoi. 
There are some toolkits for Vietnamese â€“ English bilingual text sentence alignment which are already published. 
However, most of them are not good. viXAlign is better.
